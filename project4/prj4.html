      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <p>Hover over this section to reveal more details about the game, that way you can follow the instructions carefully to play each level!</p>

      <p>In this game of, "Spot the Difference" there are 3 levels you can choose from depending on how difficult you'd like to play the game.</p>

      <p>These 3 levels are:</p>

      <div class="ol">
        <ol class="centered-list">
          <li id="easy">Easy</li>
          <li id="medium">Medium</li>
          <li id="hard">Hard</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    
    <p>Throughout each level, you are able to see multiple objects, you have only a few seconds to look at each of them. After that, BOOM! Your screen turns black and turns back on shortly after.</p>
    <p>Only up to 3 out of all the objects have changed. As you progress through each level, spotting these differences will only get harder and harder. Can you spot the difference?</p>
