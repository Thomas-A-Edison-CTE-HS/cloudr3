    <h3>About Me:</h3>

    <div class="abtme">
      <p class="info">Hello, my name is Cloud Refazo. I am born a Filipino and I have a really huge family, I have many aunts, uncles, cousins, family friends, that are either in NYC, or somewhere else in the world. As a Filipino, you must know that all of us love to party! Our parties can last entire nights, doing karaoke sessions with our family, making some of the best food, and the best late night talks with family. We are very proud to be Filipinos and we will never be embarrassed to show our true selves. Some examples of where some of my family are in the world is Canada, Florida, California, Turks &amp; Caicos, Japan, Mongolia, and of course the Philippines. I grew up in Queens, living in a very nice neighborhood. Me and my family had a decent sized house, other than just me and my parents, there was also my dog, aunt, uncle, cousins, grandma, and grandpa that lived with us in that house. All my neighbors there treated me and my family as if we were all one big family. Later in the future though, after the passing of my grandpa, me, my mom, dad, &amp; dog moved to a new house, not too far from our old one.</p>

      <p class="info">I have a lot of hobbies, though there are many to choose from (and that I would love to talk about), here are my top 2 hobbies that I absolutely love doing. For my number 1 hobby, it is playing guitar. Ever since December of last year, I have been practicing nonstop when I play guitar. When I first started out, pressing down on strings hurt my fingers so much. I could barely play any simple chords and the sound my guitar made whenever I strummed it sounded horrible. But over the span of a few weeks, I got used to the pain and I don't even feel it anymore, I was able to play a few chords now and my guitar sounded great whenever I strummed it. But now over the span of many monht up until this moment, I can play at least a few songs now! I request friends and family to see what songs they would like me to play, and if I think I can learn it, I will definitely do my best to play it for them. But if the song is difficult for my level, I'll write the song down in my notes, that way I can keep it in mind so I can play it for them in the future. <br><strong>(Here is a picture of my guitar)</strong></p>

      <p class="info">My second favorite hobby is baking. My mom introduced me to baking back in middle school, and honestly it is just so nice and peaceful making sweets, especially knowing you are gonna give them out to either family or friends! I honestly love seeing the look on people's faces when I give them some sweets I baked and they are just happy to have a taste and eat it. That is the thing that brings me so much joy whenever I bake! I write down all the recipes I learned in a little journal I keep. The only things I know how to bake is brownies, cookies, and chiffon cake. <br><strong>

    <h3>Works:</h3>
    <p>Here are links to different pages that show some of my works! The link, "Practice" is just to show a format, basically to give me an idea on how I should normally put some of my tags. The link, "Mini-Project" is to show a work of me creating a page for someone by the name of Denzel, he wants to show his recipes to people as a baker and guide and teach people how to bake! The link, "Aurora Borealis" explains how one forms, and I talk about the night where one formed over some places around the world including NYC. The link, "Mini-Project 2" is the same as Mini-Project, but this time, it is added with a CSS file and the page is more decorated. The link, "Mini-Project 3" leads to a page where I practiced on the topics of HTML and CSS. On this page, I took on the role of a web developer tasked with updating a userâ€™s webpage layout. The final link (as of right now), "Spot the Difference Game" leads you to a page where you get to play a game of spot the difference! The theme in the game is a spooky ghost school theme, and the levels range from easy to hard. The link right below it, "Spot the Difference Game (feedback-suggestions)" is basically just the same game, but I added on some suggestions that my peers recommended! Finally, my last two are "Cert Practice" and "G4C25" which are links to where I studied for my Cert Exam and a presentation for my G4C game! The Cert Practice page helped me so much with studying and it helped me pass! My G4C25 page is just to show my most impressive I have made on Unity!</p>
