    <h1>Aurora Borealis</h1>
    <h2>How is the Aurora Borealis formed?</h2>
    <p>This page is about the topic/idea of the Aurora Borealis.</p>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis, also known as the "Northren Lights" is formed through sun particles that are charged and is then ejected from from the outermost part from the sun. Thus creating solar wind.</p>
    <p>With this solar wind, it is slammed into Earth's ionosphere. This is how the aurora is born.</p>
    <p>With all these particles from the sun and the particles from Earth's upper atmosphere, they clash together, producing colorful lights. And at last, the Aurora Borealis forms.</p>
