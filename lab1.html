    <h1>Aurora Borealis</h1>
    <h2>How is the Aurora Borealis formed?</h2>
    <p>This page is about the topic/idea of the Aurora Borealis.</p>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis, also known as the "Northren Lights" is formed through sun particles that are charged and is then ejected from from the outermost part from the sun. Thus creating solar wind.</p>
    <p>With this solar wind, it is slammed into Earth's ionosphere. This is how the aurora is born.</p>
    <p>With all these particles from the sun and the particles from Earth's upper atmosphere, they clash together, producing colorful lights. And at last, the Aurora Borealis forms.</p>

    <h2>On the night of October 10th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Throughout the afternoon and evening on the day, October 10, sightings of the Aurora Borealis were spotted. Colors of pink, purple, and green could be seen all over the sky.</p>
    <p>The Aurora Borealis was able to be seen from parts of the UK and the US. The only way it could be seen this far up south is due to a geo-magnetic storm.</p>
    <p>People during the time of such a beautiful event, took pictures of the sky (including me and my friends!) to capture such a beautiful moment.</p>
